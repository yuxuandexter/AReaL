       the current model version and maximum allowed offpolicyness

        This method considers both concurrency limits and staleness constraints

        The capacity calculation ensures:
        1. The number of running rollouts doesn't exceed max_concurrent_rollouts
        2. Samples don't become too stale by limiting based on:
           - current_version: The current model version
           - max_staleness: Maximum allowed version difference

        ----------
        current_version : int

        Notes

        capacity = min(concurrency_limit, max_samples - current_samples)

        This ensures that by the time samples are consumed, they won't exceed
